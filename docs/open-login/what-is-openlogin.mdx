title: What is OpenLogin?

OpenLogin is a plug n play auth suite that combines the simplicity of passwordless authentication with the security of
non-custodial public key infrastructure (PKI). It brings the ease of passwordless, SSO, biometric authentication to any native
mobile or web applications and results in a **cryptographic key pair specific to user and application**.

For dapps, that means a key (many key types supported) pluggable into **any Web3 SDK and/or blockchain platform**. Web3 dapps looking for ecosystem interopebility can also look to using
[Wallet](/wallet/get-started) for a metamask-esque integration that uses OpenLogin flows. For web2 developers, the key enables
more security guarantees, GDPR, CPRA, or CCPA compliance, and creates a better way to give users the features they love
without sacrificing security. To experience it for yourself checkout [https://app.openlogin.com](app.openlogin.com).
