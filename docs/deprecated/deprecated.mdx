In this section, you'll find SDKs which have been discontinued, with limited developer support available around their integration. This was done in favour of creating our one stop SDK for authentication needs - [Web3Auth](docs.web3auth.io).
Web3Auth which handles your all web3 authentication needs under one umbrella.

## Web3Auth vs CustomAuth

---
Web3Auth provides a secure and uniform flow, which is highly customisable according the user needs. It is important to understand that [Web3Auth with Custom Authentication](https://docs.web3auth.io/customauth/) is different from one of the deprecated SDKs here, Torus CustomAuth.

If you're using Torus CustomAuth, it has different properties from Web3Auth's custom authentication in that it doesn't utilize the users device and other factors. The Custom Authentication in Web3Auth enables users to have the same Web3Auth flow across their applications, while having the flexibility of using their own authentication system. On the other hand, CustomAuth just provides Torus's key infrastructure and enable more people to join in using their own portal and methods.

## Web3Auth vs OpenLogin

---

OpenLogin is essentially Web3Auth. In Web3Auth, we extended the features of OpenLogin to make it more accessible and customisable according to user needs, If you have wanna read more about Web3Auth, make to sure to checkout the [documentation](https://docs.web3auth.io).
