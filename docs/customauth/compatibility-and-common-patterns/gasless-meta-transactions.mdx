title: Gasless/Meta Transactions
---

Abstracting gas away for the end user.

---

Gasless or meta transactions are transactions which have had their gas cost
abstracted and thus paid for by a different party than the user. It allows for
applications to subsidise a users gas costs allowing for a seamless experience,
particularly for users unfamiliar to the crypto ecosystem. There are primarily
two ways to implement meta transactions, on
[your smart contract itself ](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/ethereum-meta-transactions-90ccf0859e84)or
via a
[proxy/smart contract wallet](https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/wallets/smart-contract-wallets/).

There are many open source implementations of smart contract wallets
\([Argent](https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-contracts),
[Authereum](https://github.com/authereum),
[Gnosis Safe](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts)\) and standards for
implementing them on your contracts
\([EIP-1613](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1613)\) that you can use or take
reference to.

These contracts can be complicated, and take some time to deploy/use. We provide
a smart contract wallet deployment tool kit that can get you setup quickly,
which applications are free to use.
